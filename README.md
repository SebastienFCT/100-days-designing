100 days designing is the place where I will share all my designed icons. I'm a programmer, not a designer. But I use icons in most of my projects and while it's easy to find beautiful icons on the web, I feel like it's a part of my daily job I should fulfill.

My work is totally free to use/reuse/modify/etc... See the [License section](#license) for further detail.

## Buy me a coffee? :coffee:

My work is totally free of use/reuse/modification. I love open-sourcing as least as much as I love programming
